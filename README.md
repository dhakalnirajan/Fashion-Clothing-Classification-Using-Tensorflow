# Fashion-Clothing-Classification-Using-Tensorflow

A **[Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org "Official Tensorflow Website") Machine Learning pre-trained Model** using **Convolutional Neural Network** for **Fashion Clothing Image Classification**.

This is a simple Tensorflow project for classifying different types of clothing. The dataset used for this project is the Fashion MNIST dataset which can be found [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
